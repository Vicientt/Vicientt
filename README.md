## ✨ About Me

I'm a Mathematics & Statistics student with a strong interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Analytics. Most of my projects focus on cleaning datasets, building machine learning models, and developing end-to-end data workflows. I enjoy learning by doing small, real-world projects—whether it's credit risk modeling, A/B testing, uplift modeling, or building pipelines with Python and DuckDB.

Outside of coding, I love exploring new places in the U.S., improving my workflow with better tools, and sharing small learning projects on GitHub.
